# Application Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the technical architecture of the TTS Bard Echo application, focusing on the structure and integration patterns aligned with app-tts-v2 standards.

## System Components

### Frontend (Vue.js)
- Single Page Application built with Vue 3
- Composition API for composable logic
- Tauri integration for system-level capabilities  
- Component-based UI architecture with CSS token system

### Backend (Rust/Tauri)
- Cross-platform desktop application using Tauri framework
- Event-driven architecture using Rust event system
- Connection management for external services  
- SSE client implementation for real-time communication

### Data Flow
1. User interactions in frontend
2. Events sent to backend via Tauri API
3. Backend processes events and manages connections
4. External service responses received (via SSE)
5. Responses converted to events and sent back to frontend

## Integration Points

### Server-Sent Events (SSE) 
- Client implementation in Rust (`src-tauri/src/connections/client.rs`)
- Message handling via Tauri events system (`AppEvent::MessageReceived`)  
- Frontend processing via Vue composables (`useSSEHandler.ts`)

### Connection Management
- Connection configuration and lifecycle management
- Authentication token handling 
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

## CSS Architecture

Modern modular CSS architecture:
- Token-based theming system (src/styles/variables/)
- Component-specific styling with CSS variables
- Consistent design patterns aligned with app-tts-v2

## Design Patterns

### Component Architecture
- Reusable UI components following app-tts-v2 pattern
- Consistent styling through CSS token system
- Type-safe component interfaces

### Event System  
- Tauri-based event communication between frontend and backend
- Custom AppEvent enum for typed events
- Easy extensibility for new event types

This architecture provides a foundation for extensible, maintainable application with clear separation of concerns and alignment to app-tts-v2 standards.
